# CI/CD Simulation Project

This project demonstrates a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline simulated using GitHub Actions. It features:

- A simple Python application (`main.py`)
- Automated testing with `pytest` (`test_main.py`)
- An example GitHub Actions workflow configured in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run tests automatically on each push

This simulation showcases best practices in automation, testing, and version control, reflecting real-world DevOps workflows.
